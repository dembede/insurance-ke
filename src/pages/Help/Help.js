          <b>What is third-party insurance cover?</b>
          <br />
          It is a type of two and four wheeler insurance policy that covers your
          legal liability in case of any bodily or property damage caused to a
          third party by your vehicle. According to the Motor Vehicles Act,
          1988, it is mandatory for every vehicle owner to have third-party
          insurance.

          <b>What is comprehensive insurance cover?</b>
          <br />
          In addition to third-party liability, a comprehensive insurance plan
          protects your vehicle against risks like theft, vandalism, and fire.
          It also covers you if your car or bike suffers any loss or damage due
          to natural or man-made disasters such as floods, cyclones,
          earthquakes, riots, and so on.
